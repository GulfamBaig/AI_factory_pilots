# Vision Quality Control Pilot

Steps:
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Generate synthetic images (auto-generated by training script if missing) OR run `python data_generator.py`
3. Train model: `python train_vqc.py`
4. Run inference demo: `python infer_vqc.py`

Model: Small CNN trained with Keras on synthetic grayscale images. Expect >90% accuracy on the synthetic validation set used here. Replace the synthetic images with real photos taken from your production line for better real-world performance.
