AI Factory Pilots â€” Predictive Maintenance & Vision Quality Control

This repository provides two low-cost, edge-ready AI pilot solutions designed for small-scale factories:

predictive_maintenance â€” Sensor-based anomaly detection and machine health classification.

vision_quality_control â€” Camera-based defect detection using a lightweight CNN.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Deliver complete, ready-to-run pipelines (data generation â†’ training â†’ inference) that you can test locally with synthetic data.
For real-world deployment, simply replace the synthetic data with your factoryâ€™s actual sensor logs and camera images.

ðŸš€ How to Run

Set up environment

Use Python 3.9+

Create a virtual environment and activate it

Install dependencies

pip install -r predictive_maintenance/requirements.txt
pip install -r vision_quality_control/requirements.txt


Generate data & train models

python predictive_maintenance/train_pm.py
python vision_quality_control/train_vqc.py


Run inference on test samples

python predictive_maintenance/infer_pm.py
python vision_quality_control/infer_vqc.py

ðŸ“Š Accuracy

Both training pipelines are tuned to achieve 90%+ accuracy on synthetic test data.

Real-world accuracy will depend on the quality and representativeness of your factoryâ€™s data.

ðŸ”§ Customization

Replace data_generator.py logic with your own data loaders.

Adjust training hyperparameters in train_pm.py and train_vqc.py.

Retrain and deploy on edge devices for production use.
